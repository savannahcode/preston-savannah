      <h3>Her Story</h3>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I have been on a lot of Mutual dates. For context, Mutual is a dating app designed to help members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints find a lifelong partner, though occasionally some use it just for hookups. I was so tired of relationships not working out, and going on endless weird first dates. It was January and I told myself if I was still single by the Fall I would get a puppy, but after seeing a listing on Facebook marketplace for some adorable and affordable puppies I thought why wait all that time to get a little buddy to keep me company when I could have one now? So mid January I bought Suki, the cutest black and white, 8-week-old pup, from an accident litter in Eagle Mountain Utah. I didn&#39;t believe I would get in a relationship anytime soon, so it seemed like a safe choice.
      </p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On January 28th I had been on another weird Mutual date with an older guy who took me out to ice cream. On our date he would smile at me blankly in silence as he waited for me to ask him more questions about himself. Discouraged and exasperated after the date, I reflexively opened up the Mutual app again, even though it felt pointless.</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After using Mutual for several years, my matches and messages were less frequent than before, though they still rolled in slowly. Due to this shortage of available singles to swipe up or down on, I had reasoned with myself I needed to be a bit more realistic with some of my unnecessary standards, one of which was that I required those I dated to be older than me. I used to tell friends and family that if a guy was even a day younger than me, I wouldn&#39;t give him a chance. I said it was because I didn&#39;t want to date an immature guy, but I knew that it wasn&#39;t fair to generalize every 22 and under boy that way. Not everyone younger than me was less mature than me, right? I had recently decided to change my app setting to allow men my age and older to match with me, and being as particular as I was, this was a big step for me. Suddenly age 22 profiles filled my Mutual feed and I had reluctantly gone through the steps of evaluating each profile and swiping.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This time when I opened up the app I had just matched with a tall, athletic, church-going, UVU student named Preston. He was pretty cute and I allowed myself to get a little bit excited as I looked over his promising profile. His bio seemed normal enough. He had served a mission in Mexico and California, meaning he must&#39;ve been a COVID missionary like me. His relationship goals were listed as “Serious Relationship” and “Temple Marriage” which did seem to come on a little strong to me, despite the fact those were two things I most definitely wanted, but was too scared to list on my own profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To my pleasant surprise he messaged me saying, “What&#39;s up Savannah?! How are you doing?” We messaged back and forth a bit, before I gave Paige, my roommate, the rundown on how my most recent date went. She commiserated with me a moment validating my frustrations, before I held up my phone to her with a picture of Preston on his profile and asked what she thought of him. She sighed, glancing at his photo, and said something like “They&#39;re all the same at this point, there&#39;s too many to keep track of”. She was right, of course. How many times had I shown her someone&#39;s profile and their messages, till excitement had given way to disappointment after another weird date?
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I reminded myself not to get too excited, but continued to message him regularly for the next couple days till on February 2nd he asked me out for a TopGolf group date. I, of course, said yes, and 5 days later he picked me up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When I met his friends Tommy, Jake, and their dates, I found myself appreciating how friendly and engaging they were, especially since they all seemed to know each other and I was the stranger in the group that night. I took that as a green flag, considering those who have friends who are good, kind, and welcoming people are often good, kind, and welcoming people themselves.  Once I realized the selected date activity required swinging a real golf club to hit the golf ball in various target areas in a field, I found myself extremely nervous. I knew my coordination had never been a strong suit of mine and it was about to be on display in front of five people I&#39;d never hung out with in my life. I explained this to Preston and I joked he needed to stand in front of everyone to block their view of my hit. He agreed and encouraged me that no one is good when they try golfing for the first time. After missing hitting the ball entirely on my first swing I thought I would die of embarrassment, but I just tried laughing it off nervously as I often do. Preston kindly showed me some general pointers on how best to swing the club, moving my stance and instructing me on how to readjust my grip. I was grateful for his support and with his 6&#39;4 plus tall frame obstructing the other&#39;s view I felt safe to try again. When I swung the second time I missed again, laughing nervously even more. Finally, on my 3rd hit the golf club came in contact with the small white ball and flew across the grassy field below. Preston hyped me up and I finished off my turn gratefully. When it was his turn he hit the ball further and harder than anyone else. At first I felt intimidated, till I realized that based on how he had treated me during my attempts, he didn&#39;t seem to mind or care that I had no skill in golf. 
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;At one point in the conversation we discovered that my senior year of high school, taking place after I had moved from California to Utah, we went to neighboring high schools. We would later realize our parent&#39;s houses were a short 8 minutes away from each other. Preston had gone to Skyridge High School, graduating in 2019. I graduated from Lone Peak in 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After we finished golfing Jake and Tommy suggested we head over to “The Wash”, a fake bar in Provo. Since many students in the college town are LDS, drinking alcohol isn&#39;t very popular and most of the local businesses accommodate the lack of demand. The place served drinks like “Cuddles On The Beach”, “No-Jito”, “Mormon Mocha”, and “Sour Shots”. Preston ordered me a frozen hot chocolate and mozzarella sticks to share. Up until this point on the date I had enjoyed myself, but I wasn&#39;t sure whether or not either of us would hope to go on a second date. Preston was attractive, friendly, and relatively easy to talk to as first dates go, but I didn&#39;t feel like we had necessarily “clicked” yet. As we sat eating mozzarella sticks we began having more one on one conversations getting to know each other. The more we talked, the more comfortable I felt around him. We started swapping mission stories and before we knew it the rest of the group got up to head out. As we drove home we continued our tales of Mexico and Los Angeles till we had been sitting in my driveway for a while. By that point I was sure I wanted to go out with him again and I told him so. He agreed and told me this weekend he was going to be taking care of his little sister who just had back surgery, but we should keep texting and find a time that works for us to go out again.
      </p>

        ...and the rest is history!!

      <h3>His Story (Preston)</h3>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This past new years, the new years of 2023, I was determined to find the love of my life. This meant I would utilize every resource available to me. I would date a lot by being set up or asking out aquaintances, but I had never tried out dating apps before. I created several profiles on several platforms&ndash; hinge, mutual, bumble &ndash; in hopes of getting out and meeting a lot of people.</p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The more time I spent on the apps, the more I recognised that I was not interested in asking out any of the girls I had matched with. I deleted my hinge and bumble, and I was about to delete my Mutual, like I was literally holding down on the app to delete it, when I got a notification that I had matched another person. My curiosity peaked and I thought I would check out who had matched with me. It was this cutey named Savannah from Lafayette, California and her profile stood out to me more than most. I decided just for fun that I would reach out to her and if she responded to me that night, I would keep Mutual a little longer. And if she didn&#39;t respond, then I would give up on dating apps.
      </p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I did not have to wait more than forty-five minutes for Savannah to respond. The conversation seemed to flow naturally and I was having a ton of fun texting with her that week. We had a ton in common and things we didn&#39;t have in common seemed to intrigue me even more. I got her number and continued to get to know her over text for another week. That's when I knew I was finally going to ask someone out from Mutual.</p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I texted her, asking how her Top Golf game was, and she very cutely responded, “I haven&#39;t played minigolf in while, why?” Anyways I later that next week I picked her up from her house down on the corner on 700. She was soooo cute! On top of it, she was a fantastic communicator and I was having a blast getting to know her. To this point I was used to keeping the conversation flowing in each of my dates. But everything felt so natural and right when talking with Savannah.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We arrived at topgolf with our group and got everything set up. Savannah explained that she had never swung a golf club before in her life. Based on her minigolf response previously, I had anticipated this. I had planned for our entire group to have very little to no experience in golf, except for me. I was amazed though, because although she was in an entirely foreign environment, in a group of people she had met five minutes prior, and had never swung a club, she seemed very to be vibin and comfortable. Did that mean she was a natural and killed it right off the bat. Nope. Golf doesnt work that way, no matter how athletically gifted you are. But something seemed different about this girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After wrapping up topgolf we decided to grab some refreshments at a local spot in provo called The Wash. We had a lot of fun trading mission stories back and forth. As a matter of a fact we had so much fun, the conversation continued in her driveway until late at night. Don&#39;t tell our parents this but we both missed turning in a bunch of due that night at midnight because neither of us expected the date to go that long.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I can&#39;t remember exactly if it was the day or few days later but Savannah texted me and asked if I wanted to go on a double date with her and her cousin. I was sooooo excited. I normally expected whoever I took on dates to reciprocate and ask me back after two to three dates so I couldn&#39;t believe my luck. This girl was special for sure.
      </p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This date we decided to go on a winter hike where we preceded to trudge through the snow of the rock canyon park trailhead. We had a ton of fun hiking and talking in the cold, but soon decided to head back and continue our conversation over hot chocolate at Savannahs favorite study spot. A cute little cafe called “Peace on Earth.” We talked about all kinds of things, but our specific train of thought on Avatar inspired Sav to introduce me to her dog Suki. Suki was a mix between a Shar Pei and a Golden Doodle, and was super adorable. I loved playing with her that night.</p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I had so much fun that date that I set up the next with Savannah right then and there for the next week. This was super out of character for me, but I felt prompted to do so, so I set a date for the following Wednesday. I remember being extremely impressed when she pulled out her calendar to see how structured all her days were and how she seemed to have everything together. She would let me know how these specific activities or friends would come first and then if she had free time then we could schedule something. This intrigued me all that much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That following Wednesday I set up a date for us to go painting. I had an idea of having each of us having our own canvases and then trading them back and forth every five minutes and seeing how they turn out with our differing artistic styles. This didn&#39;t exactly go to plan since we found out that Savannah paints about 20x faster than I do. We still had a ton of fun painting a bunch though and at this point I knew we had something.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We wrapped our painting and went to Sav&#39;s house to watch some Avatar together. It was especially fun to watch since Savannah knew the show like the back of her hand, and I had never seen it. After finishing a couple of episodes we talked til late and I returned home.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I remember being super stressed out because everything seemed to be going in the right direction and I wanted to keep up the momentum, but I was going to gone the rest of the week on a ski trip with my friends. To make things worse, when I got up there there was no service at the cabin or resort. So this weekend was very fun but I stressed in the back of my mind at the same time. I was relieved however when I reached cell service in my drive back to have gotten a few texts from Savannah. One of which was asking if I wanted to go the gym and hang out with her that following day. I was so stoked. Savannah proceeded to be the topic of conversation for the remainder of the drive home.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That next day I picked Sav up from her house, and we heading to my gym EOS. I was giddy with excitement to be able to spend more time with her, and I had always dreamed of bringing along a cute gym partner with me. We did an upper body workout and finished with some core. Crazy how bringing a girl gym partner works because I felt extremely motivated to do well and found myself lifting much better than I usually do. I was also cool because we were both serious about our fitness and working out, but neither of us were excessive about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We headed home and made some dinner. After dinner we went back down into her basement to watch some Legend of Korra, since I had finished all of Avatar by this point. After finishing a couple episodes we continued to chat until around three in the morning. We both shared about our childhood and life before the mission. We set up another date for thursday and I then grogelly drove back home.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After these four dates I was sold. I was ready to go start running a Savannah Hilton fan page. She was so different from anyone I had ever dated and I wanted to continue to get to know her every chance I got.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That upcoming Thursday ended up being probably being top three dates I have ever been on. (Calm down, the other two are also with Savannah) We started off the day by texting a bunch, trying to see what we should do for our date later that night. I stepped out of my class and called the crew over the Crater at Midway and they were able to squeeze us into an already filled session that night for 6:30 PM.
      </p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We left around 5:15ish from Sav&#39;s to Midway. We arrived and then swam for around an hour in the crater and then headed on back toward Provo.</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Savannah was very hungry so we grabbed some JCWs and milkshakes to which we ate outside the Provo Temple. We decided to talk about all the super difficult and charged topics like politics, religion, and other beliefs. We were pleasantly surprised that all of our beliefs aligned with each other.</p>
      <p>We drove back to Sav&#39;s house to watch her favorite movie “Guardians of the Galaxy”. At the end of the movie we shared the best first kiss.</p>
      <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Not long after that we made it official and became inseparable.</p>
